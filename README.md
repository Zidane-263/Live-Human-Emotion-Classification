# Live-Human-Emotion-Classification
# Objective
Facial detection, landmark detection, gender classification and emotion recognition, based on visual appearances have great potential for real-world applications such as automatic cosmetics, entertainment, human-app interaction, advertisement promotion etc. In this project, we focus on building a Convolutional Neural Network model using Keras for live emotion classification from image inputs.
# Environment Setup
Download the codebase and open up a terminal in the root directory. Make sure python 3.10 is installed in the current environment. Then execute.
pip install -r requirements.tx
# Dataset Information
The objective of the project is to detect facial expression using image dataset. Convolutional Neural Network is used to classify the images. The output class consists of 7 different types namely angry, disgust, fear, happy, neutral, sad, surprise.
